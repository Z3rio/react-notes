# Zerio Notes
This is a notes app that I made to try and learn more about React.

# Technologies
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Local storage for "database"

# Installation
Just unzip all the files into a folder and run `npm install` in the folder through your command line.

## Building
To build this project, simply open the command line for the main project  folder and run `npm run build`, all built files will be in the `dist` directory.

## Development
To open a "dev server" of this project, simply run `npm run dev` in the main directory through your command line.
